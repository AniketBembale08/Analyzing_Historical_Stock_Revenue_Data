# Hands-on Lab: Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard
# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

This assignment is a part of  my Course (Python Project for Data Science) provided by IBM SKILL NETWORK . In this project, I'll extract essential data from a dataset and display it in a graph. The goal is to provide a clear visualization of stock data and revenue data for two companies, Tesla and GameStop.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get started with the assignment and understand how to complete each question step by step.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, requests, yfinance, BeautifulSoup, plotly)

## Define a Function that Makes a Graph

In this section, we define the function `make_graph` that is used for creating the stock data graph. You don't need to understand the internal workings of the function; you should focus on the inputs it requires.

## Question 1: Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data

Here, we use the `yfinance` library to extract stock data for Tesla and GameStop and save it as dataframes. The data is used for subsequent visualizations.

## Question 2: Use Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data

We use the `requests` library and BeautifulSoup to scrape Tesla's revenue data from a web page. This data is used in the graph.

## Question 3: Use yfinance to Extract Stock Data

Similar to Question 1, we extract stock data for GameStop using the `yfinance` library.

## Question 4: Use Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data

Using web scraping techniques, we extract revenue data for GameStop from a web page, which is required for the visualization.

## Question 5: Plot Tesla Stock Graph

This is where we create the graph for Tesla's stock data using the `make_graph` function. The graph displays historical share prices and revenue.

## Question 6: Plot GameStop Stock Graph

Similar to Question 5, we create a graph for GameStop's stock data.
